                              <p>W3Schools is a freemium educational website for learning coding online.
                                    Initially released in 1998, it derives its name from the World Wide Web but is not affiliated with the W3 Consortium.
                                    W3Schools offers courses covering all aspects of web development. W3Schools also publishes free HTML templates.
                                     It is run by Refsnes Data in Norway.It has an online text editor called TryIt Editor.
                                     and readers can edit examples and run the code in a test environment.
                                     On the site, source code examples with explanations are shown free of charge in English.
                                     Most of which can also be edited and executed interactively in a live editor. Other important code elements are hidden.
                                     So that the user can focus on the code shown (developer sandbox). The tutorials are divided into individual chapters on the development languages.
                                     In addition to the basics, application-related implementation options and examples, as well as a focus on individual elements of the programming language (so-called "references") are documented.
                                     In addition, there is a YouTube channel, which takes up and explains certain topics in web development, and an Internet forum. The languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, PHP, AngularJS, SQL, Bootstrap, Node.js, jQuery, XQuery, Ajax, and XML are supported.

                                    The Greeks or Hellenes are an ethnic group and nation indigenous to Greece, Cyprus, southern Albania, Anatolia, parts of Italy and Egypt, and to a lesser extent.
                                    other countries surrounding the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea.
                                    They also form a significant diaspora (omogenia), with many Greek communities established around the world.

                                    Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea.
                                    But the Greek people themselves have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age.
                                    Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople.
                                    Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization.
                                    The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens, Thessalonica, Alexandria, Smyrna, and Constantinople at various periods.
                                    
                                    In recent times, most ethnic Greeks live within the borders of the modern Greek state or in Cyprus.
                                    The Greek genocide and population exchange between Greece and Turkey nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor.
                                    Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine and in the Greek diaspora communities in a number of other countries.
                                    Today, most Greeks are officially registered as members of the Greek Orthodox
